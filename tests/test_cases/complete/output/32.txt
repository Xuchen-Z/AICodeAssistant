A shopkeeper has bags of wheat that each have different weights and different profits.
eg.
no_of_items 4
profit 5 4 8 6
weight 1 2 4 5
max_weight 5
Constraints:
max_weight > 0
profit[i] >= 0
weight[i] >= 0
Calculate the maximum profit that the shopkeeper can make given maxmum weight that can
be carried.
